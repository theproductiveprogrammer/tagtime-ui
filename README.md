# TagTime

*_Track your time effortlessly and accurately!_*

TagTime is an application that does stochastic time tracking. This means
it will ping you occasionally and you should tag _exactly what you are
doing at that moment_. TagTime captures tags for:

1. Where you are
2. Who you are with
3. What you are doing
4. Which project you are working on, and
5. How you are feeling (high energy/medium energy/low energy)

Because TagTime captures tags randomly it is guaranteed to (after a
while) give an accurate and clear picture of where your time goes.

TagTime works across multiple devices (Win/Lin/Mac) and synchronizes
tags entered anywhere.
