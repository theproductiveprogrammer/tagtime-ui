*_A Goal is a dream with a deadline_*



## Why guidelines

Instead of providing a single way to do something, we provide a set of
guidelines to allow for individual differences and preferences.


## Guideline Table

| Type of User | Guideline |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Casual/First Time | Explore your time investment using **TagTime**.  Review the reports and gain insights. |
| Goal oriented | Set a 'target' against a particular tag. Every day/week track against the target. |
| Need focus | Use 'Pomodoro'. Tags are automatically captured during the pomodoro. Pomodoros are automatically counted and graphed. |
| Feeling overwhelmed | Use 'break that brick'. Every time the ping window comes up review your progress on the bricks and move ahead |
| Advanced User | Create categories. Analyze reports. Capture progress and create time budgets |
